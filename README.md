# ABM-s-in-Ontario-Canada

Hello, I am a big fan of Tangerine bank which is a subsidary of Scotia Bank. Tangerine is an online bank which has almost no branches. They don't have their own ATM'S/ABM's but they depend on Scotia, Exchange network and 7 eleven Machines. The Main problem is unless and until you go and search in their website which is super slow, one can't get the details of the ATM which gives them the free access. This is the motivation of the problem where I am working on building a voice assistance system. The first challenge is getting a data set of the ATM's.
